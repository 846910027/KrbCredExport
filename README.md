# KrbCredExport
Exports Kerberos KrbCred Tickets for use in Mimikatz/Beacon from a Kerberos CCache File

Usage: python KrbCredExport.py <ccache file> <export filename>

This script will convert a Kerberos CCache file generated by the MS14-068 exploit to a valid .kirbi file, usable by both Beacon and Mimikatz.
It replicates the functionality of Mimikatz invoked using kerberos::clist "ticket.bin" /export
